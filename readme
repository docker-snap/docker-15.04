If you want to build it just issue:
snappy build package-dir

Known issues so far:
docker.svg, it is a png saved as a svg for now.
apparmor for docker is not here yet and will come soon; but containers are confined.
package.yaml has 'maintainer' for now, will be changed to 'vendor' as soon as I can build with this string.

Then copy it to  your snappy instance and install it (snappy install docker_1.3.2.001_amd64.snap).

If you need to add proxies or dns, look at meta/readme.md.
