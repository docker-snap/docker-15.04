For building docker, you need to be either in a >vivid vm or a bare host. 
It doesn't work in a container as building process is done in a docker container, you need direct connection to internet, the build process fails even if env proxies are set in the container.

to build it:
apt-get install git docker.io make

then:
git clone https://git@github.com/docker/docker
git checkout v1.6.2
git apply snappy_patches_ARCH.patch

You can also get it from gihutb: https://github.com/kickinz1/docker
armhf branch is:docker4snappy-1.6.2-armhf
amd64 branch is:docker4snappy-1.6.2-amd64

then sudo make, and wait for it to be build
the binary that we need will be in bundles/1.6.x/binary/
