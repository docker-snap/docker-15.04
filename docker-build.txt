For building docker, you need to be either in a vivid vm or a bare host. 
It doesn't work in a container as building process is done in a docker container, you need direct connection to internet, the build process fails even if env proxies are set in the container.

to build it:
apt-get install git docker.io make

then:
git clone https://git@github.com/docker/docker

git checkout release-1.3

git apply snappy_patches.patch

then sudo make, and wait for it to be build

the binary that we need will be in bundles/1.3.x/binary/
