We leverage the newer-style "snapcraft" build for building Docker here.  You will need both an "amd64" and an "armhf" 16.04+ host with functional snapcraft in order to compile binaries for this 15.04-style snap.

$ git clone --single-branch https://github.com/infosiftr/snap-docker.git
$ cd snap-docker
$ ./build-static-bins.sh

When finished, copy the contents of the "static-bins" directory, replacing either "package-dir/bin/amd64" or "package-dir/bin/armhf" (as appropriate).
