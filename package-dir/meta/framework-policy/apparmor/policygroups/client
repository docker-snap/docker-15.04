# Description: Can access the docker socket and use docker as client
# Usage: reserved

# Allow to run the docker binary to communicate with the docker service. This
# introduces a security risk since full access to the privileged socket grants
# privileged access to the system. Once this is resolved, this policy group
# may be moved to 'common'.
#
# Note: this only allows enough of the docker binary for manipulating app
# containers. This directory needs to be in sync with docker install directory.

# Tested to work with the following:
#   docker images
#   docker pull ubuntu:trusty
#   docker run ubuntu:trusty uptime
#   docker run -i -t ubuntu:trusty /bin/sh
#   docker ps -l
#   docker version
#   docker search tutorial
#   ... the tutorial ...
#
# this leaks installed apps
