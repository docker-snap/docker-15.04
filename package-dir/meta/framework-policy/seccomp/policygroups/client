# Description: Can access the docker socket and use docker as client
# Usage: reserved

# Allow to run the docker binary to communicate with the docker service. This
# introduces a security risk since full access to the privileged socket grants
# privileged access to the system. Once this is resolved, this policy group
# may be moved to 'common'.
